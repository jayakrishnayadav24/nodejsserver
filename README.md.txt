Appoinment Booking - NodeJS, React and MySQL

Pre-requisite for the project: NodeJS and Mysql

1. Open the mysql client and connect to your MySQL server

2. Import the database schema and tables from the dump 'doctor_appointment.sql' given in the project within server folder. 
	
3. Go to server folder and execute the below 2 commands:
	npm install
	npm start
	
	Note:     Your ReactJS app will be ready and running on your machine
	
	Build: If you would like to create the build(Static files ie.. Plain HTML, CSS & JS), then execute the below command:
	npm run build
	
	This will create a new folder called 'build' in the root folder of the project. You can deploy this client code in any webserver of your interest. I would suggest you to use Nginx.
